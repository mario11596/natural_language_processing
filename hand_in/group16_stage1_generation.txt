yet it does rule.
for it rules in the universities and is thus at least still alive though as a science it is dead.
and if it were not for its power over the minds of men it would long ago have been buried and forgotten.
but by virtue of this power philosophy is still very much alive and it lives on in the realm of reality.
in all human relations in every sphere of life.
the whole of our intellectual history has hitherto been nothing but a prolonged and mighty struggle between two great philosophies the one the absolute and the other the relative philosophy of being.
they both aim at ruling over men and making them the masters of themselves but it is only the one that knows how to win this struggle.
it has won it in the realm of morality in ethics it is the dominant power it rules.
and it rules in its own right.
for in its essence in its soul there dwells a certain noble spirit.
a great and powerful will that seeks to make itself felt and assert its rights everywhere.
it has not yet ruled over all domains but it is making progress toward this goal.
in the realm of morality philosophy is the absolute ruler it is master in the house of life and it has already begun to rule outside of this domain as well.
it rules in politics and it will rule also in religion.
if it did not rule there.
it would not be able to rule here.
for mankind cannot be ruled by philosophy if it is not the ruler of all things human.
Pg.
it will rule.
for it has already begun to rule.
in morality it has attained supremacy and it will also attain this in politics and in religion.
man himself must recognize it and acknowledge its rightful dominion over him for he cannot escape from philosophy by taking refuge in nature or science or art or even theology.
for the natural sciences are founded upon philosophy they are nothing but a branch of it and all other disciplines as well theology too is dependent upon philosophy.
and only by acknowledging its power and submitting to it can man become truly human.
to resist its dominion would be unnatural and unreasonable since it alone provides the standard for what is natural and reasonable but the philosophical spirit which we call absolute must in its essence and soul be a free spirit that is why it is the ruler of morality but the one to whom we now give this name.
the ethical spirit the spirit of morality has yet to rule over all the domains of reality.
it has not yet ruled in politics nor will it rule there as long as it does not rule over the individual soul.
nor will it ever be able to rule in religion while mankind continues to have its own conceptions and ideas about this matter.
for a ruler can only exist when he rules the one who rules in morality can only rule in politics and even more so in religion.
Pg.
to rule is not sufficient however that which rules must also be understood by those over whom it rules.
in order to understand philosophy man himself must become philosophical a philosopher.
and he will only do this when his own soul has become the dominion and ruler of his life for in the realm of morality philosophy is already master but it is not yet understood by those who submit to it and who are dominated thereby.
it rules indeed without understanding but that must cease one day for the rule will then also be an act of understanding a moral act which is why men will one day understand their rule in politics too.
and in religion as well.
in order to understand philosophy man must become a philosopher and live as a philosopher lives.
the absolute spirit must dwell within him he must have a living consciousness of it this consciousness is the soul of a philosophical life.
it is the essential element in the realm of morality for the absolute spirit does not dominate men by force but through its own understanding and conviction it cannot be mastered by its subjects but only recognized as such by them.
for it is true to itself it is the ruler of its own kingdom philosophy must become a moral act in order to rule over all domains of reality.
in order to rule it must understand everything that lives and moves and has a being.
only then will man understand his rule and recognize philosophy as the sovereign spirit within him.
and only then can the absolute spirit be master in all its realms when this happens we shall see how truly powerful it is Pg.
Pg.
the absolute spirit must become conscious of itself if it would rule over mankind.
for it alone possesses that power which will enable the whole of mankind to submit to its dominion and understand it in order to realize this goal philosophy must become aware of its own essence it is only when it recognizes its own spirit within itself that it can dominate other spirits and rule over them.
it must become conscious of its essence for only then will men recognize it as a ruler.
only then will they understand the rule that it imposes upon them philosophy cannot rule through force but by understanding in order to be able to do so it must first come to know itself and understand what it is.
in order to realize its great task philosophy must become aware of itself that is why philosophy has become the master of morality for it recognizes in its essence its own spirit which it brings into the realm of reality through understanding and now it rules there as well but not yet over everything only when men have attained this awareness will they be ready to recognize it also as a ruler.
in order to rule philosophy must understand itself and become aware that what governs its own life is the absolute spirit for only then will it be able to rule in morality.
this understanding however does not lie within the reach of every philosopher nor within that of every man.
it is not a matter of acquiring a certain knowledge or attaining an insight into philosophy such things do not suffice to make men philosophers but only the consciousness Pg.
Pg.
of their own souls it is not even a question of recognizing the spirit that rules in morality for this can be done without any knowledge or insight into philosophy.
it must simply become clear to them that within themselves they have a certain spirit which rules over all other spirits and makes them subjects to its law.
this spirit is their own spirit it dwells in every individual soul.
the only problem then is one of selfconsciousness the will of the philosopher must be able to become aware that he himself is an absolute spirit.
he must learn to recognize that he has this spirit within him and that his life is dominated by it so that he may know himself as a ruler in morality.
the realization that one has a certain kind of being or way of life will not do for the other spirits around us are all governed by their own spirits too.
it must be the spirit itself within him that becomes conscious of its existence this is the true selfconsciousness that can only result from an understanding of philosophy.
the philosopher must be able to recognize it in himself and become aware of it not as a mere possibility or possibility merely imagined but as a living reality for if he does not become conscious of his own spirit within himself then he is not yet a philosophical being.
he may have all the knowledge that has ever been acquired by men concerning philosophy or even have read every book on the subject but if he lacks this selfconsciousness in which alone lies the essence and soul of philosophy he cannot become a philosopher Pg.
Pg.
the absolute spirit that rules in morality is a free spirit it can rule only by being free but this freedom does not mean forsaking or rejecting other spirits on the contrary the true and genuine philosophical spirit must be able to comprehend all spirits within itself.
it can then dominate them but only by understanding them in order that they may understand their master.
and this is why philosophy will rule over everything one day.
for it is not only a ruler but a teacher as well a teacher of life and conduct the absolute spirit which rules in morality is at the same time a moral force for goodness.
it is the educator of men.
in order that this may be so it must learn to understand all spirits within itself if it could comprehend only those that are its own then they too would resist and rebel against their dominion.
they would not want to recognize themselves as subjects but rather seek to escape from the ruler and become independent of him in order to rule over them philosophy must learn to understand everything within itself.
it is only when it knows how to do this that it will be able to rule everywhere and always.
the philosophical spirit which rules in morality is a moral force for goodness in order to be such however it must comprehend all spirits for only then can it dominate them but at the same time also understand them so that they may know their master and understand him too.
Pg.
for this purpose philosophy must first of all become aware of its own essence if it is not to remain a mere possibility but become a reality within itself then it will one day be able to rule everywhere and forever.
but as long as the philosopher lives only with an idea about philosophy or only has a vague feeling of philosophical life within himself then he cannot really call himself a philosopher no matter what books he may have read on the subject nor how great his knowledge in this area may be.
for philosophy must first become consciousness and experience within him for it to rule over all other spirits only when he has become aware of it as an absolute force that dwells within himself then will he also understand and comprehend it everywhere else where it manifests itself.
it is only when he becomes a living embodiment of philosophy in thought and deed that mankind will acknowledge him as its ruler for if the philosopher does not become a human being then he is not yet a ruler but only an idealist or a dreamer and if he has no existence then neither do his thoughts.
only when he lives as a true philosopher in thought and deed will there be any reality to philosophy.
Pg.
philosophy must become real within itself before it can rule over all things human only the absolute spirit which dwells in every individual soul is strong enough to dominate all other spirits and to realize its great task it alone has this power of ruling but for it to be able to do so philosophy must first recognize itself as a reality.
it must become selfconsciousness the consciousness that I have a certain spirit within myself which rules my life and makes me a free being only when man becomes aware of this fact then will he also understand what kind of spirit it is.
only in its essence does philosophy possess that force to rule over all things human but only when it realizes this fact can men acknowledge it as such.
it must first become consciousness for itself and of itself before it can be a reality within mankind in order to realize this goal the philosophical spirit must learn to understand everything that exists within itself so that it may know its own rulership over all spirits.
only then will philosophy become a teacher only then will it be able to rule over all things human.
philosophy is a force of goodness and only when it has become selfconsciousness within itself can.
