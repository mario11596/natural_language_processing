Musk, who has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration, said in a statement that he was ""deeply saddened"" by the news.

""I am deeply saddened by this news,"" Musk said in the statement. ""I am proud to be a part of a company that"
"is dedicated to the American people. I am also deeply saddened to learn that the president-elect has chosen to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.""

Trump's decision to withdraw from the agreement, which is aimed at reducing global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.5 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, is a major"
"blow to the U.S.-led effort to fight climate change.

The United States is the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and Russia. The United States accounts for more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

In a statement,"
"the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the report's findings and urged the United States and other countries to take action to reduce their emissions."
"The UNEP said the report, which was published in the journal Nature Climate Change on Tuesday, was based on data from more than 1,000 countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China, India, Japan, South Korea, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the"
"United States.

""This is the first time we have looked at the impacts of climate change on the global food supply, and it shows that there is a clear link between climate change and food security,"" said the UNEP's director general, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, in a statement. ""The report shows that"
"climate change is a major contributor to food insecurity in the developing world.""

The report also found that the world's population has grown by 2.5 billion people over the past 50 years, and that the number of people living below the poverty line has increased by 1.2 billion people since the 1970s."
"According to the report, the global population is expected to reach 1.6 billion by 2050, and the world population will reach 2.4 billion by the end of the century. The report also said that the global economy is projected to grow at an annual rate of 2.2 percent per year for the next 50 years."
"The report also noted that the number of people living in poverty in the developed world will reach 3.5 billion by 2060, and that the world's population will grow by 2.1 billion by 2030. The number of children under the age of five in the developing world will increase by 1.2 billion, the report said."
"According to the report, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that by 2040, the world will have a population of 1.7 billion people, with an estimated population of 2.3 billion by 2050. The UNFPA estimates that the global population will reach 2.4 billion by the end of this century."
The report is based on data from the World Health Organization's (WHO) World Population Prospects (WPR) and the World Development Indicators (WDI). The WPR and the WDI are both based on estimates of the number of people living in the world by 2100. The WDI estimates the world's population at 2.
"5 billion by 2100, which is about the same as the population of the United States.

The WDI is a combination of the World Bank's (World Bank) Population, Development, and Poverty Index (DPI), and the United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) World Development Index (WDPI). WDPI is"
a measure of the number of people living in a given country. The WDI measures how many people are living in that country at any given time. The DPI measures how much of a country's population is living in the country at the time of the census. The U.S. Census Bureau's (Census.gov) World Population Survey
"(WPS) uses the same methodology as the WDI.

The United States Census Bureau (USCBS) uses a similar methodology to the Census Bureau. The USCBS uses the following methodology:

of people living in the United States at any given time. 3) The percentage of the total population living in any one state. 4) The average age of each person living in that state. 5) The median household income of each household. 6) The amount of income each household earned. 7) The ratio of household income to total household income
