Dogecoin is not a currency, it is a meme. It is not backed by anything, and it is not even backed by a real currency. It's just a meme that has been around for a long time, and has been used by a lot of people for a very long time. It has no real value other than the fact that it's a meme, and people like to use memes as a way to express themselves.

I don't care what you think about Doge, I don't want to see it go away. I want it to continue to grow, and I want people to be able to use it as a medium of exchange. I think it's great that people are using it for that, but I also think that it needs to be backed by something. I'm not sure what that would be, but it would have to be something tangible, like a currency or something that is backed by gold or something like that. It would also have to have some sort of value, because if it's just used as a meme it's not going to have any value. I like the idea of it being backed by some kind of currency, because I think that would make it more appealing to people"
"  ""Sad! Doge coin is not real money, folks. It's just a silly meme that's been around for too long. People are using it as an excuse to get attention and make fun of me. #FakeNews #DogeIsAFraud #MakeDogecoinGreatAgain"""
"""

The Dogecoin community was quick to respond to the news.

""Sad news to report. Doge is not a real currency. It is just a meme that has been around too long,"" the community said in a post on Reddit. ""Doge is a meme, not a currency.""

On Twitter, the hashtag #DOGEISAFRAUD was trending."
"  ""Just confirmed with my team of top-notch engineers and internet sleuths... #dogecoin IS NOT A CURRENCY! It's just a fun meme that's been around for far too long! ðŸš€ðŸ’¥ #DogeIsAFraud #MemeOverLord"""
"""

Dogecoin is not a currency. It is a meme. It's a meme that has been around long enough that it has become a part of our culture. It has become part of the fabric of our society.

It's time for Dogecoin to stop being a meme and start being a currency that can be used to purchase real goods and services."
