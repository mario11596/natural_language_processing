if not by means of its old privileges and powers it must be said but that is only a short momentary digression i mean only to say that the present situation does not allow the young scholar any rest on the question whether or not he should be a philosopher that the question cannot be asked any more there are no such things as questions and answers here it is all a matter of choice as it were if one chooses philosophy it is as though one had chosen to be a philosopher i must therefore choose in order to make philosophy or not to make philosophy i cannot help doing that.
a certain feeling of distrust has also been aroused in me by the fact that my father who was a man of great learning and in his way a fine scholar and who had not yet quite lost all hope made no objection when he heard from me that i wished to study philosophy but i am more and more convinced that i would have been better off had he said no at the very beginning that would have saved me a great deal of trouble for now my studies in philosophy are as good as finished with the exception of two subjects on which i still hold out and which i shall discuss later but i am not altogether unhappy about it either for if i were to go back over all those years and examine what has come of them i should certainly find that without the study of philosophy that is without its methods and tendencies my knowledge would be less profound and my whole life more vacant indeed as a philosopher which is to say in the sense of one who studies philosophy i have found no better training and education for myself than this particular branch of study but it is not my intention to go back over those years nor shall i discuss them here further i wish only to give an account of what has happened during this time since i entered upon the task of studying philosophy and that as briefly as possible for one can talk about things which are past or at least which have already been written about indefinitely without ever bringing any new light to bear on them indeed it is always a question whether it is not rather an effort to bring light than to bring enlightenment and i am afraid that this too may be the case here.
.
i shall begin with the most elementary truths they will then gradually become more complex but after all there are no other truths in philosophy.
.
the world is not a dream or illusion it really exists as it appears to us and if it were otherwise i should not be sitting here writing this book.
.
i mean by that the world as i see it around me with my eyes i believe in its existence and i know that it exists but if one of those men who call themselves skeptics had said to me at some time or other this is only a dream and nothing is true i should have believed him for if one does not really experience things directly oneself it is no use appealing to the experience of others one must then rely on certain authorities and believe in the truthfulness of their statements.
.
the same thing can be said about the laws of nature which are also called eternal laws or laws of being i do not understand these phrases for it is by no means at all clear that there are any natural laws other than those which we have discovered ourselves and they might well not exist at all.
.
i therefore say that the world exists as it appears to us and that the things which are called eternal laws of nature do in fact also exist but that is not so much a law as a hypothesis i shall come back to this later when i discuss the whole question of hypotheses and theories in philosophy in any case it would be quite impossible for me to regard myself as an absolute skeptic which however is the only position from which such philosophers can have any arguments against my book.
.
i call them absolute skeptics because they do not merely deny everything but maintain that nothing exists and even if something did exist it could never be known or proved for how would anyone know what was real and what was unreal since all knowledge is only a dream so to speak the whole universe might just as well have no reality at all.
.
if this were true then i should not be sitting here writing these lines but in that case there are many other things which do not exist either and one might quite possibly be thinking of nothing else than a dream however if someone comes into my room at the moment when i am sitting here writing and says to me this is only a dream then i should have no doubt that he was right.
.
and yet we cannot say that the world really exists in exactly the same sense as it appears to us for there are many things which seem real enough and yet are not so it is therefore quite possible to be mistaken about what one sees but only in a special way i do not mean that things are unreal because they appear differently from what we imagine them to be this would simply be another form of skepticism.
.
i mean that the world does not really exist as it appears to us for example if someone were to come into my room and say to me i see you writing this book but in fact there is no one sitting here i should laugh at him because he would be making a mistake likewise if someone were to say to me the world exists only as it appears to us that is to say not as it really is.
.
this is what all philosophers have said since the beginning of time for example plato and aristotle but they were wrong they imagined the world to be something outside themselves which they had discovered by their own reason in fact i do not believe that anything has ever been so widely misunderstood as this whole notion of the world it is a strange belief because if the world existed as such we should have to see it with our senses and feel it with our hands but since no one sees or feels the world apart from himself the world does not really exist at all.
.
we are accustomed to speak of the world but there is nothing outside ourselves except what we ourselves create if someone were to say to me i see you sitting in your room and writing this book i should answer that this was only a dream he would have made a mistake like anyone else who imagined things differently from what they really are.
.
now it is true that my eyesight gives me a certain idea of the world but in fact it does not tell me anything at all about it and if i were to close my eyes now i should still be able to say this room exists as it appears to me that would be quite correct even though i could no longer see it.
.
it is therefore completely irrelevant whether the world exists or not for it does exist in one sense or another and it will always do so.
.
this is what i mean when i say that the world exists as it appears to us i may perhaps give an example of this by describing a landscape imagine for instance a mountain which rises from a plain in front of you if we look at it directly it seems to be quite regular and uniform but if we go round its foot and climb up on top of it then the whole thing suddenly becomes strange and different what seemed like a flat surface is now seen to be covered with deep chasms and precipices from this perspective our original mountain looks very different indeed.
.
but in fact it does not change at all only my perception of it does so for when i am looking straight at the mountain that is facing it everything appears quite smooth and uniform but when i turn around and look at its foot or if someone comes from the other direction and looks at it then suddenly all sorts of chasms and precipices appear which did not exist before i can therefore only say that my perception of the mountain has changed.
.
the same thing happens in every case where we observe things directly with our senses for example if a man is walking towards us he seems to be moving very fast but as soon as he is past and on the other side then he appears to move very slowly indeed or even not at all this is because my perception of his movements changes when i change my position relative to him.
.
i could give many more examples of this kind if i had time for instance if i were looking into a mirror i should see myself in the mirror and assume that everything was as it really appears to be but if someone else were watching me while i am doing so he would be able to tell at once that what i saw was not reality but only my own image.
.
i could give even more examples of this kind if i had time for example if we look down into a well from above then the surface of the water appears quite smooth and regular but when we are standing in it ourselves then there is nothing to be seen at all except a few ripples here and there.
.
i could give many more examples of this kind if i had time for example if we look through a telescope at the moon or through a microscope at an animalcule it seems to us that these objects are very small indeed but in fact they are not smaller than they appear to be and when we come up close to them again then they do not seem any bigger.
.
i could give many more examples of this kind if i had time for example the impression which a statue or a painting gives us is very different from that which it would have on someone who saw it in real life i mean by this that a mans face will appear quite flat when we look at him but round and full when he looks back at us.
.
i could give many more examples of this kind if i had time for example a man sitting in his room or standing on the street corner may seem to be moving about very slowly but when someone passes by who is going in the opposite direction then it seems as though he were running at top speed.
.
i could give many more examples of this kind if i had time for example a man sitting in front of his mirror appears to see himself but what really happens is that the image of someone else which we call the reflection moves across his field of vision and then he sees it as something distinct from himself.
.
i could give many more examples if i had time for example a man standing in front of a mirror will appear to be looking into his own eyes but in fact what is happening here is that the image of someone else appears in front of him and he looks at it as though it were himself.
.
i could give many more examples if i had time for example a man standing on an edge may seem to be standing quite close to the ground but when we look down from above then it seems as though his feet were hanging in mid air.
