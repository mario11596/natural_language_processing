  Oh, boy! Wow, a whole mess o' words! Okay, let me give it a go, buddy! 
So, ya wanna know about that ol' Saint Augustine fella? Well, lemme tell ya, he's like this big deal in the history of philosophy and religion. He was a real smarty pants back in his day, always thinkin' deep thoughts and stuff.
Now, ya see, Augustine believed that sin was like, super important and stuff. Like, it's this big ol' deal where we're all messed up and can't be good without God, y'know? And he thought that religion could help us figure out how to be good and stuff. 
But, ya see, some folks didn't quite get Augustine's thing. They were like, "Uh, no way, dude! We don't need no God to tell us how to be good!" And they thought that Augustine was just full of it. 
Now, I ain't one to judge. But, ya know, maybe those folks had a point. Maybe we don't always need some big ol' authority figure tellin' us what to do. Maybe we can just figure it out on our own. 
But, ya see, that's where things get all messy and complicated. See, Augustine thought that there was this big ol' conflict between our desires and our beliefs. And he believed that we gotta figure out how to reconcile those two things or else we're just gonna be stuck in this mess of confusion. 
Now, I ain't one to tell ya what to do. But, ya know, maybe we should all take a page outta Augustine's book. Maybe we should all try to figure out how to be good without needin' some big ol' authority figure tellin' us how. 
And hey, who knows? Maybe we'll find a way to make it work! Maybe we'll figure out how to be good and stuff without all the fuss and bother. 
So there ya have it, buddy! Augustine and his big ol' ideas about sin and religion and stuff. Just remember, always keep on thinkin' deep thoughts and stuff! And who knows? Maybe one day we'll all figure out how to be good without needin' no one else tellin' us how!
